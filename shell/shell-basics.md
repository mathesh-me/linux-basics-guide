## Shell

### Shell Basics

#### What is a shell?

A shell is a program that allows a text=based interaction between the user and the operating system. It takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. In olden days, it was the only user interface available on a Unix-like system. Nowadays, we have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in addition to command line interfaces (CLIs) such as the shell.

#### Commands in the shell

A command is a text-based instruction to the shell to perform a specific task. When we run some command it executes a Specific Program to achieve a specific task.
